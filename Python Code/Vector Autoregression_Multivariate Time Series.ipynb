    "## Introduction\n",
    "We have seen issues in the housing market such as the financial crisis of 2008 that impacted the American economy for some years. Our analysis will look at the long-term trends in the Canadian housing market to give us some indication of the future trends, such as a similar crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "We will take both qualitative and quantitative data in order to make a conclusion for the future. How we are using two different models to acheive an understanding of multivariate analysis and how to pick the best predictive tool. Our hypothesis is that the Canadian housing market will experience a downturn similar to the American Housing Crash of 2008.\n",

    "In order to prove our analysis we will utilize various sources. We will utilize data from the Bank of Canada, from Statistics Canada and from news sources. This Jupyter Notebook specifically will focus on the first of two multivariate forecasting models: VAR. Vector Autoregression will be discussed in the next section. For our feature selection we will use Residential Mortgage figures, The Housing Affordability Index, Prime rate figures and\n",

    "### Why Utilize VAR? A brief Introduction to multivariate analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study we will compare two different multivariate tools to pick the best. In this Jupyter notebook we will focus on the VAR model. The VAR model is designed for multivariate analysis, which is suitable for a predictive analysis that requires more than one variable. \n",
    "VAR model, each variable is modeled as a linear combination of past values of itself and the past values of other variables in the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an analysis of the Canadian Housing market, we have multiple time series that influence each other, thus we use vector autoregression modeled as a system of equations with one equation per variable (time series). Specifically, we have Residential Mortgage figures, The Housing Affordability Index, Prime rate figures and figures outlining the 5-year Conventional mortgage- that all influence each other.  Therefore the VAR is a good choice for our Canadian Housing Market analysis. "
